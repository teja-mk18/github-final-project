# GitHub Final Project: Simple Interest Calculator

A simple interest calculator that computes interest based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and time period in years.

## Input

- `p`: Principal amount  
- `t`: Time period in years  
- `r`: Annual rate of interest (in decimal or percentage)

## Output

- `Simple Interest = (p * t * r)`

## Example

If:
- `p = 1000`
- `t = 2`
- `r = 0.05` (or 5%)

Then:
- `Simple Interest = 1000 * 2 * 0.05 = 100`
